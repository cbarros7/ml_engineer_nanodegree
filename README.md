## Description :speech_balloon:
This nanodegree will develop advanced machine learning techniques and algorithms and how to package and deploy your models in a production environment. Additionally, work was done on the Amazon SageMaker service to deploy trained models in a web application and evaluate the performance of the models.


## Structure :hammer:
The following is the main structure of the program with the projects developed in each of them:  

**1.) Software Engineering Fundamentals**:
 + **Objective:** Write production-level code and practice object-oriented programming for integration into machine learning projects. 
 + **Project:** [Build a Python package](./package_pypi/basic_algebra_ml)

<br>

 **2.) Machine Learning in Production**:
 + **Objective:** Learn how to deploy machine learning models to a production environment using Amazon SageMaker. 
 + **Project:** [Deploy a sentiment analysis model](./sagemaker_sentiment_analysis)

<br>

 **3.) Machine Learning Case Studies**:
 + **Objective:** Apply machine learning techniques to solve real-world tasks; explore data and deploy both built-in and custom-made Amazon SageMaker models. 
 + **Project:** [Plagiarism detector](./plagiarism_detector)

<br>

**4.) Machine Learning Capstone**:
 + **Objective:** Select a machine learning challenge and propose a possible solution.
 + **Project:** [Capstone project](./capstone_project)

<br>
